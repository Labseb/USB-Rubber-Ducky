Here is a list of all firmware available for the ducky-key.

- c_duck_v2.1.hex : Allow the device to work as both a HID and standard storage device at the same time. 
- usb.hex         : FAT Duck.
- duck_v2.hex     : Original firmware.
- m_duck.hex      : Multi-payloads ->  inject.bin - default; ducky will always run this on insertion into a computer,
                    Enable NUMLOCK (inject2.bin) or enable CAPSLOCK (inject3.bin)
                    Then push the reset switch on the naked duck, to trigger the 2nd/3rd payload.
